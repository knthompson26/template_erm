# Template script for E-REML

This is a working repository for conducting environment-wide or exposome-wide mixed linear models using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) . 

The mixed linear model is computed in two steps: 

1. Compute environmental relatedness matrix (ERM)
2. Compute mixed linear model with ERM included as a random effect estimated using REML

This is the beginning of the repository for the project titled: Drawing parallels across complex trait genomics and social science to combine environmental and genetic risk factors for depression in a longitudinal US cohort. Pre-regsitered here: https://osf.io/akzhd/
